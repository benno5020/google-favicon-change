Tampermonkey scripts to change your Gmail and Google Calendar favicons.

**Please note** that - as far as I know - you will need to host the favicons on a server with a https domain.

The calendar icon will not show the current day. I simply did not care enough to implement this. I'll happily accept any pull requests though.

You will need to install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to use the scripts.
